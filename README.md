# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns and trends, and gain insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. It includes variables such as passenger class, age, gender, fare, and survival status.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the raw dataset and any intermediate data files created during the cleaning process.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts used for data processing and analysis.
- **outputs/**: Final reports, visualizations, and summaries generated from the analysis.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Correct data types
   - Remove duplicates
   - Feature engineering

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summary statistics
   - Data visualization (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots)
   - Correlation analysis
   - Exploration of relationships between key variables (e.g., age, gender, passenger class) and survival rates

## Findings

- [Summarize key insights and trends discovered during the EDA, such as the impact of gender, age, or class on survival rates.]

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
